# Tixati Useful Knowledge Guide

## How to get a channel:

To register a channel, first go to the channel tab at the top.  Click add in the top left under the home tab.
Then, click add link.  Insert the channel link and once again click add.  Your client will then connect.
It may take a while to gather all the information about the channel.



## How a channel works:

Each channel has a collection of magnet links for torrents.  Click on one and it will ask if you want to download this torrent and then it will redirect you to the transfers tab and begin the transfer.
Links are provided by channel users, and there are different promotion on each channel that give youu different capabilities.  You can be banned or muted on a channel
On the info tab is the channel information.  On the stream tab, you can stream or connect to somone elses audio or video stream.  In the share tab you can control what links you do and dont share.
The rest of the tabs are advanced options and not needed for the every day user.
You will also notice a user tab



## Useful channel commands:

All commands begin with a forward slash `/`. Here are some useful commands:

First of all, get a nick so that we can recognize and remember you.
```
/nick yourclevernickhere
```

This enables timestamps on channel messages.
```
/timestamps on
```

This disables the join/leave messages for a channel. It can be a bother to scroll through hundreds of lines of join notifications just to find what was said most recently.
```
/notify off
```

Click the "Commands" button next to the chat input line to see what other commands are available. Different commands may be available depending on your level.



## Sharing in channels

If you have something you'd like to share, you can put it in your share list so that others in the channel can find it. To access your share list click the "Share" button at the top. Then click the "Edit" button to start editing your share list. Click "Save Changes" when you're done. Here you can write anything you feel like, it's your own personal billboard. Pasting magnet links and web links here counts toward your total share count. Try to keep your list somewhat organized so that people can easily browse it.

You can get magnet links from your own transfers and paste them into your share list. Just go to the "Transfers" window, right-click any of your transfers in the list, choose "Share" > "Copy Magnet Link" and then paste it into your share list.

You don't actually need to be seeding the files to share the corresponding magnet link but it is courteous to do so, especially when that share has few peers.

### Global and channel-specific shares

The "Share" window shows your global share list, but you can also have channel-local share lists. In the "Channels" window choose a channel, click on the "Share" tab and you'll see the share list specific to that channel. By default, channel-local share lists are a mirror of your global share list, but you can edit them separately from the global share list. This is useful if you have some shares that are off-topic for a certain channel or only relevant for another channel.

### Share list directives

There are special share list directives that can make managing your share list easier. For example you can add all your transfers to a share list with a single directive without having to manually copy all the magnet links to your share list. Or you can mirror all shares from one channel-local share list to another. Here follows a list of some share directives:

```
##mirror:transfers
```
This directive inserts all your current transfers where it occurs in the share list.

```
##mirror:complete
```
Shares complete transfers.

```
##mirror:standby
```
???

```
##mirror:seeding
```
Shares transfers that you're seeding.

```
##mirror:downloading
```
Shares transfers that are currently downloading.

```
##mirror:queued
```
???

```
##mirror:offline
```
Shares transfers that are stopped.
